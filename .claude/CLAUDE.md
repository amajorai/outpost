# Data Versioning Contract

The desktop app supports users on different app versions simultaneously (perpetual license model with 1-year update windows). This means a backup created on v2.0 may be restored on v1.5, and a project file from v1.0 must still open on v3.0. **All persistent data must be versioned and forwards/backwards compatible.**

## Versioned Data Surfaces

Every one of these must carry a `schemaVersion: number` field:

| File | Location | Current version |
|------|----------|----------------|
| Layer data | `thumbnails/{id}/layers.json` | 1 |
| Crash recovery | `recovery/{id}.json` | 1 |
| Revision snapshots | `revisions/{id}/{revId}.json` | 1 |
| AI project graph | `ai-projects/{id}/graph.json` | 1 |
| Backup manifest | `manifest.json` inside ZIP | 1 |

The SQLite schema version is tracked via `PRAGMA user_version` — **not** try-catch ALTER TABLE statements.

## Rules for Every Schema Change

1. **Bump `schemaVersion`** in the affected data structure.
2. **Write a migration function** named `migrateV{n}ToV{n+1}(data: unknown): V{n+1}Type`.
3. **Add it to the migration pipeline** that runs sequentially on load: `v1 → v2 → v3 → current`.
4. **Never remove or rename a field** — only add new optional fields with defaults that preserve existing behavior.
5. **New fields must not change behavior when absent** — treat missing as the old default.

## Migration Pipeline Pattern

```typescript
const MIGRATIONS = {
  1: migrateV1ToV2,
  2: migrateV2ToV3,
} as const;

function migrate<T>(data: { schemaVersion: number } & Record<string, unknown>): T {
  let current = data;
  while (current.schemaVersion in MIGRATIONS) {
    current = MIGRATIONS[current.schemaVersion as keyof typeof MIGRATIONS](current);
  }
  return current as T;
}
```

Always call `migrate()` on read. Always write with the current `schemaVersion`.

## Backup ZIP Manifest

Every backup ZIP must include a `manifest.json` at the root:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "appVersion": "1.2.1",
  "createdAt": "2026-05-20T12:00:00Z",
  "dataSchemaVersions": {
    "layers": 1,
    "recovery": 1,
    "revisions": 1,
    "aiProjects": 1,
    "sqlite": 3
  }
}
```

On restore, **reject the backup with a clear error** if any `dataSchemaVersions` value exceeds what the running app version supports. Never silently restore an incompatible backup.

## SQLite Schema Versioning

Use `PRAGMA user_version` to track the schema version. Run migrations in a transaction at app startup:

```typescript
const version = db.pragma('user_version', { simple: true }) as number;
if (version < TARGET_VERSION) {
  runSqliteMigrations(db, version, TARGET_VERSION);
}
```

Never use try-catch ALTER TABLE in **new migrations** — it hides schema drift and makes the version state unknowable. New migrations must rely on `PRAGMA user_version` to know what's already been applied.

The one exception is the **`safeAddColumn` helper in `lib/db.ts`**, which catches "duplicate column name" errors specifically for the bootstrap-from-untracked-installs path. Pre-tracker installs may report `user_version = 0` while having a fully-migrated schema, and the migration loop has to be safe to re-run on them. New migrations should still use `safeAddColumn` for any `ADD COLUMN` so the bootstrap path remains forward-safe.

## License Version Gate

When the app starts and the user's license `expiresAt` is in the past, check the running app version against GitHub releases. If the running version was released after `expiresAt`:

- Show a blocking modal explaining which version they're entitled to.
- Provide a direct GitHub release download link to the last entitled version.
- Do **not** auto-downgrade programmatically — link them to the correct binary.

The update checker must also respect `expiresAt`: fetch GitHub releases, find the newest version with `published_at ≤ expiresAt`, and only offer that version.

# Ultracite Code Standards

This project uses **Ultracite**, a zero-config Biome preset that enforces strict code quality standards through automated formatting and linting.

## Quick Reference

- **Format code**: `bun x ultracite fix`
- **Check for issues**: `bun x ultracite check`
- **Diagnose setup**: `bun x ultracite doctor`

Biome (the underlying engine) provides extremely fast Rust-based linting and formatting. Most issues are automatically fixable.

## Core Principles

Write code that is **accessible, performant, type-safe, and maintainable**. Focus on clarity and explicit intent over brevity.

### Type Safety & Explicitness

- Use explicit types for function parameters and return values when they enhance clarity
- Prefer `unknown` over `any` when the type is genuinely unknown
- Use const assertions (`as const`) for immutable values and literal types
- Leverage TypeScript's type narrowing instead of type assertions
- Use meaningful variable names instead of magic numbers - extract constants with descriptive names

### Modern JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use arrow functions for callbacks and short functions
- Prefer `for...of` loops over `.forEach()` and indexed `for` loops
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) for safer property access
- Prefer template literals over string concatenation
- Use destructuring for object and array assignments
- Use `const` by default, `let` only when reassignment is needed, never `var`

### Async & Promises

- Always `await` promises in async functions - don't forget to use the return value
- Use `async/await` syntax instead of promise chains for better readability
- Handle errors appropriately in async code with try-catch blocks
- Don't use async functions as Promise executors

### React & JSX

- Use function components over class components
- Call hooks at the top level only, never conditionally
- Specify all dependencies in hook dependency arrays correctly
- Use the `key` prop for elements in iterables (prefer unique IDs over array indices)
- Nest children between opening and closing tags instead of passing as props
- Don't define components inside other components
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for accessibility:
  - Provide meaningful alt text for images
  - Use proper heading hierarchy
  - Add labels for form inputs
  - Include keyboard event handlers alongside mouse events
  - Use semantic elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, etc.) instead of divs with roles

### Error Handling & Debugging

- Remove `console.log`, `debugger`, and `alert` statements from production code
- Throw `Error` objects with descriptive messages, not strings or other values
- Use `try-catch` blocks meaningfully - don't catch errors just to rethrow them
- Prefer early returns over nested conditionals for error cases

### Code Organization

- Keep functions focused and under reasonable cognitive complexity limits
- Extract complex conditions into well-named boolean variables
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Prefer simple conditionals over nested ternary operators
- Group related code together and separate concerns

### Security

- Add `rel="noopener"` when using `target="_blank"` on links
- Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless absolutely necessary
- Don't use `eval()` or assign directly to `document.cookie`
- Validate and sanitize user input

### Performance

- Avoid spread syntax in accumulators within loops
- Use top-level regex literals instead of creating them in loops
- Prefer specific imports over namespace imports
- Avoid barrel files (index files that re-export everything)
- Use proper image components (e.g., Next.js `<Image>`) over `<img>` tags

### Framework-Specific Guidance

**Next.js:**
- Use Next.js `<Image>` component for images
- Use `next/head` or App Router metadata API for head elements
- Use Server Components for async data fetching instead of async Client Components

**React 19+:**
- Use ref as a prop instead of `React.forwardRef`

**Solid/Svelte/Vue/Qwik:**
- Use `class` and `for` attributes (not `className` or `htmlFor`)

---

## Testing

- Write assertions inside `it()` or `test()` blocks
- Avoid done callbacks in async tests - use async/await instead
- Don't use `.only` or `.skip` in committed code
- Keep test suites reasonably flat - avoid excessive `describe` nesting

## When Biome Can't Help

Biome's linter will catch most issues automatically. Focus your attention on:

1. **Business logic correctness** - Biome can't validate your algorithms
2. **Meaningful naming** - Use descriptive names for functions, variables, and types
3. **Architecture decisions** - Component structure, data flow, and API design
4. **Edge cases** - Handle boundary conditions and error states
5. **User experience** - Accessibility, performance, and usability considerations
6. **Documentation** - Add comments for complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code

---

Most formatting and common issues are automatically fixed by Biome. Run `bun x ultracite fix` before committing to ensure compliance.
